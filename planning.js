Why Did You Make This Game?
To pay homage to my deeply obsessive and addicting obsession with Sonic the Hedgehog, I have decided to create my very own Sonic the Hedgehog game.
Whether it's the popular (and hilarious) Sonic movies, the Netflix show "Sonic Prime", the IDW comics, or the copious amounts of fan content that exists on the internet and social media platforms, I have always harbored a strong and fond interest for a singular character: Shadow the Hedgehog.
With his compelling character arc, awesome design, "I don't care" attitude, and tear-worthy backstory, what's not to love about Shadow the Hedgehog, a character who almost always stole the show with his red highlights and air shoes.
However, canon Shadow content is very limited. He barely got any screentime in Sonic Prime and Sonic Boom. Only one movie has been made on him so far. Sonic is often given importance over him.
I was dissapaointed, as I did not get to see much of Shadow during shows and movies, and was too broke to afford the games. 
Therefore, I decided to create the next biggest project of my life: A homemade video game starring Shadow the Hedgehog.
"Sprinting to Sonic" is an intriguing maze-based game which delves deeply into the multifaceted and highly complex relationship between Shadow and Sonic. Two souls who are simultaneously polar opposite and very alike.
The show "Sonic Prime" and the movie "Sonic 3" were huge inspirations for this concept, as both showed the hedgehogs' dynamics in fascinating yet deeply different aways.
In "Sprinting to Sonic", I decided to take all the things I admire about the franchise and put it into a game. I poured my heart and soul into making this game, so I hope it's enjoyable!
Thus, coding, storyboarding, and creating this game was a beautiful experience, as I was able to experiment and tamper with a single, compelling notion: what are the legnths Shadow would go to in order to see Sonic?
The answer, to my surprise, turned out to be "everything."

What Does This Game Have?
- Beautiful graphics & pixel art (which I made lol)
- Witty banter and dialogue
- Elements from the old Sonic games :)
- A Snapcube reference (iykyk)
- A certainly surprising main storyline for sure
- Both simple AND challenging game levels
- A short timeframe so you can enjoy it quickly :D
- Dr. Eggman, of course <3
- A heartwarming and satisfying ending imo

How to Play:
- It's pretty simple!
- Use the arrow keys to maneuver Shadow out of the maze 
- Enjoy!

SCRIPT:

*It starts on a black screen with white words: "Sprinting to Sonic: A Maze Game"*
*The game starts when you click a blue button that says "START!!"
*Shadow sits alone in the forest. Amy approaches him while running.*

AMY: Shadow! You're late!
SHADOW: Hmph!
SHADOW: I am the Ultimate Lifeform.
Shadow: Matters of time mean nothing to me.
SHADOW: ...
SHADOW: What am I late for again?
AMY: Duh! Your wedding!
SHADOW: WEDDING?!
AMY: Yeah. Sonic has been waiting at the altar for hours-
SHADOW: SONIC?!
SHADOW: THAT IDIOT?
SHADOW: THAT STUBBORN PRICK?
SHADOW: THAT ARROGANT BLUE GUY WHO THINKS HE'S BETTER THAN ME?
SHADOW: UGH.
AMY: Oh.
AMY: So..you're not gonna marry him?
SHADOW: ...
SHADOW: Don't be preposterous, Amy Rose.
SHADOW: Of course I am. Let'g go.

*Scene changes. Shadow finds himself in a maze in the sky*

AMY: I dunno. Maybe Tails left his maze designs behind?
SHADOW: How pathetic.
*For those who don't know, Shadow has a long standing unspoken beef for Tails, and maintains a desire to beat him up in every universe. No one knows why.*
AMY: Whatever, Shadow.
AMY: Now hurry!! We'ev only rented the venue till eight!!!
SHADOW: Ugh.
*Shadow spots a chaos emerald at the end of the maze.*
SHADOW: Wait a minute...that's the chaos emerald.
SHADOW: Maybe I can use it.
*The player must make Shadow travel across the maze using the arrow keys to reach the gem on the other side.*
*When Shadow is near the gem, he reaches out to it. Upon touching the gem, he yells-*
SHADOW: CHAOS CONTROL!!!ðŸ’š
*Like he always does. And the gem promptly transports him to the next level of the game.*

*Shadow ends up in a pretty lake surrounded by mountains, Amy with him. The borders of a maze are still there, but they are different this time.*

SHADOW: A lake?
SHADOW: Amy...are you sure we're going the right way?
AMY: Yup!
AMY: Rouge said this was a shortcut. She found it with Knuckles when they got lost one time. :)
SHADOW: Amusing.
SHADOW: This will hopefully let us reach Sonic in time.
AMY: Aww Shadow, are you worried about him?
AMY: That's so sweet of you. <3
SHADOW: Worried?
SHADOW: No. I just can't wait to beat uo his stupid goofy face.
AMY: ~I know when you're lyingggggg.~
AMY: ~You careeee about him.~
SHADOW: Shut up.
*The player now moves Shadow to the next chaos emerald, using the arrow keys once again. This time is slightly more simpler, as the maze is a bit easier.*
*Shadow reaches the emerald.*
SHADOW: CHAOS CONTROL!!!ðŸ’š
